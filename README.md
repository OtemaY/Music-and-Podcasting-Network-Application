"Melo App" - Music and Podcasting Network Application

I designed a user-centered app based on real user feedback, for music and podcast streaming with novel artist-fan engagement features.
The purpose of this app, is to provide a platform for consumers to listen to their favourite podcast episodes and music and connect with their favourite artists on a personal/intimate level. 
In the making of this project, the user was at the center of the application building from beginning to end. In the ideation stage of the project, the requirements elicitation phase included interviewing target groups to build personas and user scenario stories. Based on the feedback received from the target groups, the application requirements were laid down, guiding the drawing of the initial prototype.

The initial prototype, its choice of design and features, and usability, as well as following iterations of the prototype, were all guided by the design process as elicited by David Benyon. Every good and user-centered design goes through iterations after being evaluated by its target group of users. 

The feedback collected from individuals and through focus group discussions using evaluation methods such as think-aloud evaluation was used to gather feedback and make changes to arrive at the final prototype.
